00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.366
<i>This kid's not Crosby.</i>

3
00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.955
<i>Fletcher, well maybe.</i>

4
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.197
<i>Fletcher?</i>

5
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.125
<i>As in Stevie Fletcher?</i>

6
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.916
<i>You're showing your age now.
Come on. Get real.</i>

7
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.890
<i>I feel like I'm the only one
who's being real at this point.</i>

8
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.963
<i>Have you seen the
Slaughter kid skate though?</i>

9
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.728
<i>We have a station hockey team.</i>

10
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.174
<i>You've seen me skate.
I can skate.</i>

11
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.173
<i>This kid plays hockey
like he's in the NBA.</i>

12
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.640
<i>He doesn't even see the ice!</i>

13
00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:31.985
<i>Yeah, but he scores goals.</i>

14
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.761
<i>That's what you do in hockey.</i>

15
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.446
<i>He misses opportunities with his teammates.</i>

16
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.143
<i>He showboats.
He floats sometimes.</i>

17
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.284
<i>If I were his coach, you know
what? I'd scratch the guy.</i>

18
00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.228
You <i>were</i> his coach? Oh man. Come on.

19
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.635
<i>Scratch the number one player?</i>

20
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.692
<i>Now you're just being cranky.</i>

21
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.250
<i>Look, the only reason anyone's
even pushing this kid</i>

22
00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:49.697
<i>is because he's from a tough
neighbourhood, North Preston.</i>

23
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.992
<i>Yeah. First black Nova Scotian
to make it to the NHL.</i>

24
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.535
<i>Look, you gotta admit.</i>

25
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.261
<i>That's a Cinderella
story right there.</i>

26
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.850
<i>Yeah. It's a fairytale.</i>

27
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.702
<i>That's the right word.</i>

28
00:01:58.952 --> 00:01:59.952
<i>Fairytale.</i>

29
00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.480
<i>A 9-year-old
metro girl has a new lease on life</i>

30
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.802
<i>thanks to surgery at the
Hospital for Sick Children.</i>

31
00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.391
<i>Tracey Hooper was given...</i>

32
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:57.056
<i>Mattie! Carter! Breakfast!</i>

33
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.350
You know they're
ripping us off, right?

34
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.940
I mean there is no way
that bill was $450.

35
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.462
<i>I'm-I'm gonna talk to 'em.</i>

36
00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:04.642
Mm hmm.

37
00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:06.437
<i>Morning Mama.</i>

38
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.655
Ah good morning baby.

39
00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.570
Thank you.

40
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:11.567
Morning Dad.

41
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.114
Mattie.

42
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.004
The guys down at the
cement company keep asking

43
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.628
when you're gonna come
down to the office

44
00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.123
and sign some of
your Junior A cards.

45
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.787
Whenever you want, Dad.

46
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.313
Now let's see if
he comes correct

47
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.912
over the next quote on cement.

48
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.879
<i>Ah shit!</i>

49
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.206
I got it.

50
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.174
How many inches in
five square feet?

51
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:36.641
720.

52
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.930
<i>Thank you, Carter.</i>

53
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:38.927
<i>See boy?</i>

54
00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.177
<i>Come work for me.</i>

55
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.060
<i>Slaughter and Son.</i>

56
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.431
<i>Your brains, my skills?</i>

57
00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:44.934
<i>We'll make a killing.</i>

58
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.737
Yeah. I'm out.

59
00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.817
<i>Where you going?</i>

60
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.365
Mattie, come here.

61
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.792
Who's that?

62
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.213
I don't know.

63
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.201
<i>Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.</i>

64
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.162
<i>Oh</i> okay.

65
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.644
<i>So this is what you're pushing.</i>

66
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:41.532
Yeah.

67
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:42.533
That guy give it to you?

68
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:43.534
<i>Teddy'?</i>

69
00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.331
<i>Uh huh.</i>

70
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.263
<i>Yeah he just let me hold it for a bit.</i>

71
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.540
<i>Well Christ, she sharp,
ain't it?</i>

72
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.383
<i>Yeah. I can't even lie.</i>

73
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.172
<i>It's pretty sweet.</i>

74
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.670
For a pimp car.

75
00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:57.922
Get in.

76
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.073
So that white man's promising
you the world, eh?

77
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.843
I haven't even signed
the contracts yet

78
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.918
and already he's got a
scout lined up to see me.

79
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.513
Yeah he's just drooling

80
00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.210

81
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.799
Yeah. You know what they say,
he's the best.

82
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.918
Yeah. Bullshitter.

83
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.762
Maybe.

84
00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.554
But yeah, Mom and Dad,

85
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.643
You know, Dad's
running around town

86
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.479
bragging about you and shit.

87
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.472
Hey. That's my boy.

88
00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.473
Who?

89
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.693
You know, Mattie Slaughter.

90
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.437
Maybe he's got a right.

91
00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.782
Yeah.

92
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.946
What? You got a new phone?

93
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.245
Uh business line.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.115

<i>Carter.
All right. Let's go.</i>

103
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.444
<i>Yo Holmes, to Bel Air.</i>

104
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.707
<i>This place never gonna change, boy.</i>

105
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.254
<i>It's high school for you.</i>

106
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.501
Yeah.

107
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.674
<i>Mm. Mm mm.</i>

108
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.673
Look at all that sweetness.

109
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:27.923
Oh you like that, huh?

110
00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.889
Oh I love it.

111
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:37.855
<i>Hey-</i>
. <i>Hey-</i>

112
00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.273
<i>Indiscernible Crawley.</i>

113
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.647
What are you dressed
like that for girl?

114
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.273
It's asshole repellent.

115
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.442
She got you.

116
00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:46.692
Yo fuck you.

117
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:47.861
Oh you wish.

118
00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.247
Are we still on for lunch today?

119
00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:54.618
Will you get the work done?

120
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.586
I'll see you at lunch.

121
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.919
Man, that girl is
a super freak, bro.

122
00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.929
<i>Skoo!</i>

123
00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.176
Choose that boy.

124
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:15.688
Man C, I gotta go.

125
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.557
<i>All right. All right later.</i>

126
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.285
<i>You gonna pick me up from the rink later?</i>

127
00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:20.869
Don't know. Mm. What you saying?

128
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.399
Wanna go for a ride?

129
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.536
<i>Special telescopes
to see things that human eyes can't.</i>

130
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.372
<i>For this picture, three
telescopes were used</i>

131
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.788
<i>and each picked up
a different type of light.</i>

132
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:42.461
The guy at Tattoo Village
said he'd do us two for one.

133
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.630
I bet he did.

134
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.971
I'm not gonna get inked
by some rando dude.

135
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:53.811
My dad would torch his shit.

136
00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.092
<i>X-rays have a lot of energy</i>

137
00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.557
<i>so when we look at the
universe in x-ray light,</i>

138
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.684
<i>we see some of the hottest gas</i>

139
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.653
<i>and the most
powerful explosions.</i>

140
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:08.025
<i>Infrared light is given off
by much cooler objects</i>

141
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.526
<i>than the stars.</i>

142
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.834
So what's X?

143
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.935
Come on Indiscernible. You know this.

144
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.239
We went over this the other day.

145
00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:31.841
<i>I know.
Just give me</i> a <i>second.</i>

146
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.913
If I didn't need
math to graduate,

147
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.814
I'd be telling algebra
to kiss my ass!

148
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.199
Okay. Here.

149
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.376
Indiscernible.

150
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:04.248
Hey. Um Mattie just...

151
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.215
we're just going
over some algebra.

152
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:07.754
Right. Are we gonna do this?

153
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.719
Dude. Relax.

154
00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:15.096
Uh I'm sorry. I gotta go.

155
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.218
<i>Are you still coming
to my home tonight?</i>

156
00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:18.468
Yeah.

157
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.857
<i>Later gator.</i>

158
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.898
Here. Don't lose this one.

159
00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.148
<i>I won't.</i>

160
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.136
<i>All the white ministers got
like three baby mammas</i>

161
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.379
<i>so I told my ma
hey, I'm gonna start going</i>

162
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.668
<i>to a white church.</i>

163
00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.257
I'm serious.
Don't gotta dress up.

164
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.893
Don't gotta listen to
no T.D. Jakes wannabe

165
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.464
put your business on the street.

166
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.910
You in and out in like thirty
minutes and they feed you.

167
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.506
<i>Feed you?</i>

168
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.009
Yeah. You know them little
wafers and the juice?

169
00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.475
All right.

170
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.478
What are you gonna do
about the music though?

171
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.598
I say we bring them some
up home music, you know?

172
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
Show 'em how we do.

173
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.481
<i>You forget how to walk?</i>

174
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:12.731
You were in my way.

175
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.113
<i>Just leave it, man.</i>

176
00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.039
No, no, no, no.
You were in my fucking way.

177
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.463
Dwight, let's get
out of here man.

178
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.047
Who the fuck you talking
