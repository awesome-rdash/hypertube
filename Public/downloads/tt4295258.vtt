00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.366
<i>This kid's not Crosby.</i>

3
00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.955
<i>Fletcher, well maybe.</i>

4
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.197
<i>Fletcher?</i>

5
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.125
<i>As in Stevie Fletcher?</i>

6
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.916
<i>You're showing your age now.
Come on. Get real.</i>

7
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.890
<i>I feel like I'm the only one
who's being real at this point.</i>

8
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.963
<i>Have you seen the
Slaughter kid skate though?</i>

9
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.728
<i>We have a station hockey team.</i>

10
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.174
<i>You've seen me skate.
I can skate.</i>

11
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.173
<i>This kid plays hockey
like he's in the NBA.</i>

12
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.640
<i>He doesn't even see the ice!</i>

13
00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:31.985
<i>Yeah, but he scores goals.</i>

14
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.761
<i>That's what you do in hockey.</i>

15
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.446
<i>He misses opportunities with his teammates.</i>

16
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.143
<i>He showboats.
He floats sometimes.</i>

17
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.284
<i>If I were his coach, you know
what? I'd scratch the guy.</i>

18
00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.228
You <i>were</i> his coach? Oh man. Come on.

19
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.635
<i>Scratch the number one player?</i>

20
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.692
<i>Now you're just being cranky.</i>

21
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.250
<i>Look, the only reason anyone's
even pushing this kid</i>

22
00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:49.697
<i>is because he's from a tough
neighbourhood, North Preston.</i>

23
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.992
<i>Yeah. First black Nova Scotian
to make it to the NHL.</i>

24
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.535
<i>Look, you gotta admit.</i>

25
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.261
<i>That's a Cinderella
story right there.</i>

26
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.850
<i>Yeah. It's a fairytale.</i>

27
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.702
<i>That's the right word.</i>

28
00:01:58.952 --> 00:01:59.952
<i>Fairytale.</i>

29
00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.480
<i>A 9-year-old
metro girl has a new lease on life</i>

30
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.802
<i>thanks to surgery at the
Hospital for Sick Children.</i>

31
00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.391
<i>Tracey Hooper was given...</i>

32
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:57.056
<i>Mattie! Carter! Breakfast!</i>

33
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.350
You know they're
ripping us off, right?

34
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.940
I mean there is no way
that bill was $450.

35
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.462
<i>I'm-I'm gonna talk to 'em.</i>

36
00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:04.642
Mm hmm.

37
00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:06.437
<i>Morning Mama.</i>

38
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.655
Ah good morning baby.

39
00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.570
Thank you.

40
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:11.567
Morning Dad.

41
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.114
Mattie.

42
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.004
The guys down at the
cement company keep asking

43
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.628
when you're gonna come
down to the office

44
00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.123
and sign some of
your Junior A cards.

45
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.787
Whenever you want, Dad.

46
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.313
Now let's see if
he comes correct

47
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.912
over the next quote on cement.

48
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.879
<i>Ah shit!</i>

49
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.206
I got it.

50
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.174
How many inches in
five square feet?

51
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:36.641
720.

52
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.930
<i>Thank you, Carter.</i>

53
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:38.927
<i>See boy?</i>

54
00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.177
<i>Come work for me.</i>

55
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.060
<i>Slaughter and Son.</i>

56
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.431
<i>Your brains, my skills?</i>

57
00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:44.934
<i>We'll make a killing.</i>

58
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.737
Yeah. I'm out.

59
00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.817
<i>Where you going?</i>

60
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.365
Mattie, come here.

61
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.792
Who's that?

62
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.213
I don't know.

63
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.201
<i>Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.</i>

64
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.162
<i>Oh</i> okay.

65
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.644
<i>So this is what you're pushing.</i>

66
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:41.532
Yeah.

67
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:42.533
That guy give it to you?

68
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:43.534
<i>Teddy'?</i>

69
00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.331
<i>Uh huh.</i>

70
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.263
<i>Yeah he just let me hold it for a bit.</i>

71
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.540
<i>Well Christ, she sharp,
ain't it?</i>

72
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.383
<i>Yeah. I can't even lie.</i>

73
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.172
<i>It's pretty sweet.</i>

74
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.670
For a pimp car.

75
00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:57.922
Get in.

76
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.073
So that white man's promising
you the world, eh?

77
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.843
I haven't even signed
the contracts yet

78
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.918
and already he's got a
scout lined up to see me.

79
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.513
Yeah he's just drooling

80
00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.210

81
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.799
Yeah. You know what they say,
he's the best.

82
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.918
Yeah. Bullshitter.

83
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.762
Maybe.

84
00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.554
But yeah, Mom and Dad,

85
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.643
You know, Dad's
running around town

86
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.479
bragging about you and shit.

87
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.472
Hey. That's my boy.

88
00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.473
Who?

89
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.693
You know, Mattie Slaughter.

90
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.437
Maybe he's got a right.

91
00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.782
Yeah.

92
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.946
What? You got a new phone?

93
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.245
Uh business line.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.115

<i>Carter.
All right. Let's go.</i>

103
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.444
<i>Yo Holmes, to Bel Air.</i>

104
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.707
<i>This place never gonna change, boy.</i>

105
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.254
<i>It's high school for you.</i>

106
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.501
Yeah.

107
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.674
<i>Mm. Mm mm.</i>

108
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.673
Look at all that sweetness.

109
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:27.923
Oh you like that, huh?

110
00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.889
Oh I love it.

111
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:37.855
<i>Hey-</i>
. <i>Hey-</i>

112
00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.273
<i>Indiscernible Crawley.</i>

113
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.647
What are you dressed
like that for girl?

114
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.273
It's asshole repellent.

115
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.442
She got you.

116
00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:46.692
Yo fuck you.

117
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:47.861
Oh you wish.

118
00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.247
Are we still on for lunch today?

119
00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:54.618
Will you get the work done?

120
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.586
I'll see you at lunch.

121
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.919
Man, that girl is
a super freak, bro.

122
00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.929
<i>Skoo!</i>

123
00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.176
Choose that boy.

124
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:15.688
Man C, I gotta go.

125
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.557
<i>All right. All right later.</i>

126
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.285
<i>You gonna pick me up from the rink later?</i>

127
00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:20.869
Don't know. Mm. What you saying?

128
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.399
Wanna go for a ride?

129
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.536
<i>Special telescopes
to see things that human eyes can't.</i>

130
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.372
<i>For this picture, three
telescopes were used</i>

131
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.788
<i>and each picked up
a different type of light.</i>

132
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:42.461
The guy at Tattoo Village
said he'd do us two for one.

133
00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.630
I bet he did.

134
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.971
I'm not gonna get inked
by some rando dude.

135
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:53.811
My dad would torch his shit.

136
00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.092
<i>X-rays have a lot of energy</i>

137
00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.557
<i>so when we look at the
universe in x-ray light,</i>

138
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.684
<i>we see some of the hottest gas</i>

139
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.653
<i>and the most
powerful explosions.</i>

140
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:08.025
<i>Infrared light is given off
by much cooler objects</i>

141
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.526
<i>than the stars.</i>

142
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.834
So what's X?

143
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.935
Come on Indiscernible. You know this.

144
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.239
We went over this the other day.

145
00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:31.841
<i>I know.
Just give me</i> a <i>second.</i>

146
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.913
If I didn't need
math to graduate,

147
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.814
I'd be telling algebra
to kiss my ass!

148
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.199
Okay. Here.

149
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.376
Indiscernible.

150
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:04.248
Hey. Um Mattie just...

151
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.215
we're just going
over some algebra.

152
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:07.754
Right. Are we gonna do this?

153
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.719
Dude. Relax.

154
00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:15.096
Uh I'm sorry. I gotta go.

155
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.218
<i>Are you still coming
to my home tonight?</i>

156
00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:18.468
Yeah.

157
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.857
<i>Later gator.</i>

158
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.898
Here. Don't lose this one.

159
00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.148
<i>I won't.</i>

160
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.136
<i>All the white ministers got
like three baby mammas</i>

161
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.379
<i>so I told my ma
hey, I'm gonna start going</i>

162
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.668
<i>to a white church.</i>

163
00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.257
I'm serious.
Don't gotta dress up.

164
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.893
Don't gotta listen to
no T.D. Jakes wannabe

165
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.464
put your business on the street.

166
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.910
You in and out in like thirty
minutes and they feed you.

167
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.506
<i>Feed you?</i>

168
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.009
Yeah. You know them little
wafers and the juice?

169
00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.475
All right.

170
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.478
What are you gonna do
about the music though?

171
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.598
I say we bring them some
up home music, you know?

172
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
Show 'em how we do.

173
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.481
<i>You forget how to walk?</i>

174
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:12.731
You were in my way.

175
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.113
<i>Just leave it, man.</i>

176
00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.039
No, no, no, no.
You were in my fucking way.

177
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.463
Dwight, let's get
out of here man.

178
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.047
Who the fuck you talking to man?

179
00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:20.593
<i>Hey. I'm going about my business</i>

180
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.926
<i>all of a sudden this
little fucking monkey</i>

181
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.997
<i>comes out of nowhere.</i>

182
00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.428
<i>Hey. Say that shit again.</i>

183
00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:25.499
<i>Todd, back up, man.</i>

184
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:26.889
<i>Say that shit again, huh?</i>

185
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:27.993
<i>You heard what I said.</i>

186
00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.391
<i>I'm gonna fuck you up son.</i>

187
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.088
<i>I can say it again.</i>

188
00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.811
<i>No, I'm gonna fuck you up.
Keep talking shit.</i>

189
00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.007
<i>Dwight!</i>

190
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.773
Miss Downey, you didn't
hear what this racist...

191
00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.720
I do not care what he said.
My classroom now.

192
00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.684
Both of you.

193
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:40.926
Ah come on.

194
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.348
Hey. Disperse.

195
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:53.981
<i>Sit down.</i>

196
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.528
That's my coat.

197
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.256
<i>It's mine now. What are you gonna do?</i>

198
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.907
<i>Come on. Come on. Take it.</i>

199
00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.659
<i>Give me my friggin' coat.</i>

200
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.661
Why don't you make
me white girl?

201
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.211
Lay off her, Trina.

202
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.334
Mind your business.

203
00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:15.836
Just walk away.

204
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920
That's my jacket.

205
00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.637
Give her her coat back.

206
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.220
What?

207
00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:26.585
You think 'cause
your dad's a cop

208
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.103
I won't mess you up too?

209
00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:30.397
Take your shot.

210
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:40.819
<i>You know what?</i>

211
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.992
<i>Here.</i>

212
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.707
<i>It stinks anyway.</i>

213
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.747
<i>Let's go.</i>

214
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:47.993
<i>Half breed.</i>

215
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.264
So what's the problem?

216
00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.936
If this is a race thing,

217
00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.438
it ends right now.

218
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.234
This is stupid shit.
Smarten up, boys.

219
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.279
What are you,
Martin Luther King?

220
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:21.198
Please Miss Downey,
you can't do nothing.

221
00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:22.821
Can I go?

222
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.823
Sit down, Dwight.

223
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.547
You have anything to say?

224
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:36.883
I'm done with this.

225
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.606
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

226
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.306
Todd. Todd. I am talking to you.
- Don't you touch me.

227
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.471
Dwight, you can go.

228
00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:48.020
Office.

229
00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:49.684
Now.

230
00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.373
<i>Fuck forgetting it, Mom.</i>

231
00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.318
I'm not gonna lie for you.

232
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.319
I'm not gonna do it.

233
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.662
So what's up? Did you take...?

234
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.580
You don't want me to tell Dad
you're planning on leaving him.

235
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.003
That is the definition of a lie.

236
00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:20.877
I'm gonna go.

237
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:23.755
Fuck!

238
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.468
Hey, hey. Hey.

239
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.310
What's wrong with your mom?

240
00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:30.021
She's sketch, man.

241
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.263
You Okay?

242
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.856
I know my dad's not perfect.

243
00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.194
Hey.

244
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:42.367
Listen to this.

245
00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:46.408
It's brand new out
of Controller.

246
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.406
Yeah. Their shit is crazy.

247
00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:57.839
I love this.

248
00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.442
I'm gonna make it
my new ring tone.

249
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:00.376
Only for me.

250
00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.626
Okay.

251
00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:02.669
All right.

252
00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.468
This shit's real.

253
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.234
<i>Ape called my parents.</i>

254
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:18.815
<i>What?</i>

255
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:21.234
I said the ape
called my parents.

256
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.778
<i>The ape?</i>

257
00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.776
Miss Downey, dummy.

258
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:25.777
Hey Todd.

259
00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.620
You're an idiot, Todd.

260
00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:31.207
You talk such fucking nonsense.

261
00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:34.248
I can't wait till you're in
our rear-view mirror, man.

262
00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.462
Let's go.

263
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:38.047
Hey. Wait a second, man.

264
00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.916
We gotta talk about the marina.

265
00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:43.966
Shit. Right. Um
yeah tonight. Okay?

266
00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.384
Whoa. Hold on.

267
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.470
I gotta let my dad know
by tomorrow, all right?

268
00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.550
Or else they're gonna
hire someone...

269
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.518
You see this?

270
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:55.467
<i>These guys are unbelievable.</i>

271
00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:56.728
<i>Just-just leave it man.</i>

272
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:58.772
No. Watch this.

273
00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:00.078
<i>Monkey, she don't want you.</i>

274
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.649
What the fuck man?

275
00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.739
<i>Yeah what the fuck you gonna do about it?</i>

276
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.292
<i>You want to do
something about it?</i>

277
00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.408
Let's just go.

278
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.957
<i>- You got</i> a <i>problem</i> man?
<i>- Fuck you, man.</i>

279
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:11.910
He's being an idiot, J.
Let's go.

280
00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:13.908
<i>You want to do something about it?</i>

281
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.677
<i>You guys think you can
take whatever you want?</i>

282
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:16.845
<i>Fuck you, you piece of shit.</i>

283
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.869
<i>Yeah monkey!</i>

284
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.080
<i>Come on, come at me!</i>

285
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.330
John!

286
00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.499
<i>John.</i>

287
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.092
<i>Jesus.</i>

288
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:26.884
<i>You're at that school to learn.</i>

289
00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:29.131
<i>I can't believe you kids.</i>

290
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.975
Mom, we were just
playing around.

291
00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:32.469
No.

292
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.938
Once again you got wrapped
up in Todd's shit.

293
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.366
How many times have
I gotta tell you?

294
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.983
You get in trouble,

295
00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.978
you don't have some fancy ass
lawyer father who can fix it.

296
00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.228
Don't get sucked in.

297
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.522
Okay. Hey.

298
00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.945
Look, all he did was
throw an empty can

299
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.613
at the guy's stupid car.

300
00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:50.987
John.

301
00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:54.332
Cars are like religion
to those people.

302
00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:55.854
<i>Cadillacs next to
plywood shacks.</i>

303
00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.209
<i>Those guys,</i>

304
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.637
they just love nothing
better than a fight.

305
00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.208
That's it.

306
00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.765
<i>You just need to stay away from them.</i>

307
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:02.836
Hey.

308
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:04.675
He was just defending himself.

309
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:08.012
He can't help it if those boys
from Preston act like savages.

310
00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:09.506
<i>And before you start,</i>

311
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.553
me speaking the truth
doesn't make me racist.

312
00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:12.799
Whoa, hey Mom.

313
00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.469
Todd was the one who started it.

314
00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.188
And those black boys don't know
how to turn the other cheek?

315
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.602
Well maybe the white boys

316
00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.117
shouldn't start fights
they can't finish.

317
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:24.647
Of course you'd feel that way.

318
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.148
Okay.

319
00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:29.196
You're good.

320
00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:30.193
Clean yourself up.

321
00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:31.194
Okay.

322
00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.536
I gotta go to work.

323
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.872
Dinner's in the oven, love.

324
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.333
Thanks Mom.

325
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.554
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

326
00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.546
Wow.

327
00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.547
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

328
00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:53.140
Your mom's a bitch.

329
00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:57.057
Hey. Look, she's just upset.
She said some things...

330
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.850
She keeps talking this bullshit.

331
00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.689
Okay. So what do
you want me to do?

332
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.434
You want me to tell my mom
what she can and cannot say

333
00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:06.062
in her own house?

334
00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.030
That should go over well.

335
00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.492
I want you to stand up.

336
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.405
Whatever.

337
00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.015
<i>It's a good thing
I'm not pregnant.</i>

338
00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.121
No. Jay... Indiscernible.
Indiscernible, wait.

339
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.623
Your son <i>is</i> a star.

340
00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.046
Mr. Jacobsen says I could
be the next Crosby.

341
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.544
Crosby, huh?

342
00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.259
<i>Don't you get a big head.</i>

343
00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.601
Ain't nobody putting your
ugly mug on a cereal box.

344
00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:37.842
Thank you.

345
00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:39.220
Endorsements will come.

346
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.270
That's a-that's a
whole other game.

347
00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.516
Look.

348
00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.857
A lifetime ago I was Mattie.

349
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:50.277
<i>Well, maybe didn't have
those hands but, uh,</i>

350
00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.117
<i>I know talent when I see it.</i>

351
00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:54.952
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Slaughter,</i>

352
00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.572
<i>there are a lot of living
rooms across this country</i>

353
00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.620
<i>I could be seated in right now.</i>

354
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.368
I've chosen to be here.

355
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:04.996
It's been a long time since
I've seen a kid skate

356
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.123
with the kind of speed,
power Mattie has.

357
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.713
<i>Hurray today.</i>

358
00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.757
<i>Man, whose ride is that?</i>

359
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.689
<i>Carter, this is Mr.
Jacobsen, the sports agent.</i>

360
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.010
<i>He flew in to see your brother.</i>

361
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.429
<i>Carter.
Okay.</i>

362
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.018
<i>So that's your ride.</i>

363
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.728
<i>Well it's a rental.</i>

364
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:21.970
<i>Carter.
Nice.</i>

365
00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:25.770
My bro sick on the ice,
ain't he?

366
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.096
Well that's why we're here.

367
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.226
Mm hmm.

368
00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:36.153
So, uh, when I look at a
player I look for character.

369
00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:38.450
<i>Ah. The milk's spoiled.</i>

370
00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:39.696
<i>Ma?</i>

371
00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.291
<i>The fridge is fucked up.</i>

372
00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:44.661
Carter, just listen to
what the man has to say.

373
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.990
<i>That's Mama's thing.</i>

374
00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:47.500
<i>Look, it's nice to meet you boy</i>

375
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.045
<i>but let's just make
this paper, all right?</i>

376
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.670
<i>Look. He shoots.
Boom! Mattie scores.</i>

377
00:20:53.919 --> 00:21:00.177
Woo!

378
00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:03.350
Well let's, uh, let's hope he
brings that enthusiasm

379
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.722
to the stands, huh?

380
00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.745
I've already said this to Mattie

381
00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.067
<i>so I'll say it again here.</i>

382
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.486
<i>I know this work you've
put in has not been easy.</i>

383
00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:15.732
I know that's right.

384
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:16.988
<i>My</i> job <i>now?</i>

385
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.202
<i>To place Matthew with a family,</i>

386
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.664
the best NHL franchise
that will allow

387
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:25.581
all that hard work he's put in
over the last ten plus years,

388
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:29.205
the work you've done,
to pay off.

389
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:30.877
You want Mattie in the big city?

390
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.670
<i>Some of these small towns here,</i>

391
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.686
<i>the other team's fans
throwing bananas on the ice</i>

392
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.802
<i>while he's playing.</i>

393
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.592
<i>I</i> hear you,

394
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:41.433
but none of that will matter
when Mattie goes first round.

395
00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:43.097
The press says top twenty.

396
00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.517
It's the press.

397
00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:47.765
<i>Your son could be the
future of hockey.</i>

398
00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>I want to make sure
that happens for him,</i>

399
00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:53.729
<i>for this family.</i>

400
00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:58.325
What do you say?

401
00:21:58.567 --> 00:21:59.614
His life.

402
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.407
Mm hmm.

403
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.032
Well Mattie?

404
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:07.956
Uh yeah.

405
00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:09.202
Yes.

406
00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:15.217
<i>We're gonna do amazing things together.</i>

407
00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:17.132
Thank you.

408
00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:18.755
<i>John, we'll...</i>

409
00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.722
<i>we'll talk later.</i>

410
00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:26.095
<i>Yeah.</i>

411
00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:27.345
<i>Fine.</i>

412
00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:31.308
Sit down. Eat some dinner.

413
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.623
I know you got some questions
about what's been going on

414
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:57.548
between me and your mother.

415
00:22:57.793 --> 00:23:00.467
She just needs some time,
that's all.

416
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:03.182
She's not coming back, Dad.

417
00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.272
You expecting someone?

418
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.485
<i>Mattie Slaughter.</i>

419
00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:17.321
Hi Mr. Crawley.

420
00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.531
Can <i>I help</i> you?

421
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:21.400
<i>Shit. Sorry.</i>

422
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.449
<i>I totally forgot he's supposed
to be tutoring me right now.</i>

423
00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:27.369
<i>Uh is this a bad time?</i>

424
00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:28.884
Yeah actually <i>I</i> prefer...

425
00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:33.209
<i>No. No. It's fine.</i>

426
00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:35.294
<i>You want to see me in
that cap and gown, right?</i>

427
00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:37.959
<i>I gotta do this math thing.</i>

428
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:39.648
Yeah. Well I gotta
go get ready so...

429
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:41.553
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

430
00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:12.834
<i>All right. We'll see you later.</i>

431
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:14.169
<i>Goodbye Mr. Crawley.</i>

432
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.129
<i>See ya.</i>

433
00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:32.138
Quit it.

434
00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.307
You're making me nervous.

435
00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:43.816
<i>All right. Done.</i>

436
00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:03.715
You got it.

437
00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:08.091
All right. Let's celebrate.

438
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.264
Go to the basement
and celebrate!

439
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:43.255
Sorry.

440
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.377
My dad's kind of
weird about that.

441
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.263
<i>Does your, uh,</i>

442
00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:57.310
<i>does your dad play?</i>

443
00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:59.479
No.

444
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:05.198
<i>He has it in his mind that I'm
gonna be the next Sheila E.</i>

445
00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:07.988
<i>Clive Davis, maybe.</i>

446
00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.703
What about Sharon Osbourne?

447
00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:17.167
Definitely Clive.

448
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:23.336
<i>You like this?</i>

449
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:27.507
Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.

450
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:30.506
<i>It's fucking real.</i>

451
00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:34.351
Yeah. I'm not feeling it.

452
00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:37.722
Okay.

453
00:26:40.224 --> 00:26:42.352
This is more your speed, huh?

454
00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:48.194
Who's this?

455
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.158
<i>Uh</i> Henry Green.

456
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:59.876
<i>Your dad is gonna kill me, Indiscernible.</i>

457
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.998
No. Fraser will never know.

458
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:10.296
<i>Besides, my dad likes you.</i>

459
00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:13.265
That Slaughter boy's really
going places, Indiscernible.

460
00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:15.147
Why can't you bring
home someone like him?

461
00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:18.980
S
